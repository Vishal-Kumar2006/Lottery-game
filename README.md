# React + Vite

Building this project gave me hands-on experience with Reactâ€™s core concepts and how they work together to create dynamic applications. Looking forward to learning more about hooks, context API, and optimizing performance! ðŸš€

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
